# Whack-a-Mole Game ðŸŽ¯

A simple Whack-a-Mole game built to learn and practice JavaScript.

## How to Play
- Click "Play" to start the game.
- Click on the moles as they appear to score points.
- Avoid missing moles to maintain your health.
- The game ends when your health reaches zero.

## Overview
This project is a basic implementation of the classic Whack-a-Mole game using vanilla JavaScript. It features:
- Randomized mole appearances.
- Score tracking and level progression.
- Health points
- Restart functionality.

## Features

- **Random Mole Generation**: Moles appear in random holes, keeping the game dynamic and challenging.
- **Score and Health Management**: Players earn points for successful hits and lose health for missed hits. The game ends when health reaches zero.
- **Level Progression**: The game increases in difficulty as the playerâ€™s score increases, with faster mole appearances.

## Learning Points

- **DOM Manipulation**: Using `getElementById` and `getElementsByClassName` to interact with HTML elements.
- **Event Handling**: Adding event listeners for user interactions like clicks and mouse events.
- **Image Preloading**: Preloading images to ensure smooth transitions and game performance.
- **Timers and Intervals**: Using `setTimeout` and `clearTimeout` for timed events and intervals.
